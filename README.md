Distilling the Essence Workshop
===============================

You can use paper for this, but if you'd like to play with Cucumber Pro, here's what to do:

1. [Fork this repo](https://github.com/cucumber-ltd/cukeup-nyc-2014-workshop/fork) (you'll need a Github account)
2. Copy the URL of the forked project (should be something like `https://github.com/<your-username>/cukeup-nyc-2014-workshop`)
3. Open https://app.cucumber.pro and log in
4. Click 'Add project'
5. Paste in the URL from step 2

Now you should be able to edit / save the scenario(s) back to Github from Cucumber Pro!
